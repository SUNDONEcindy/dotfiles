# SSH Config File


## Generating keys: ##
    # Max security, not compatible with CentOS 7/ubuntu 12.04:
        # `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 60 -C "jeff@jeffwidman.com macbook air"`
    # Max compatibility:
        # `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jeff@jeffwidman.com macbook air"`

    # SSH key-gen options:
    # -t specifies the type; ed25519 is better than RSA, but not widely supported. RSA is preferred over ECDSA due to suspected NSA tampering.
    # -a specifies the rounds for bcrypt when saving the private key using the new OpenSSH format
    # -C comment
    # RSA specific options:
        # -b specifies the bits. This option is ignored when generating ed25519 keys because it's not applicable.
        # -o specifies saving the private key locally using a new OpenSSH format that uses bcrypt.
            # For ed25519 keys, this is always turned on and don't need to specify it.
            # While Cyberduck supports this (due to supporting ed25519 key format), some ftp clients don't support this yet.
            # For them you can omit this flag and the private key will be saved using the older PEM format.


## Example using ProxyJump to access a DB server via a jumpbox ##
#Host jbox
    # HostName can be either domain name or IP address
    #HostName jumpbox.test.com
    #User jeff
    #Port 1093

    #Host rc-db
        #Hostname db
        #User jeff
        #ProxyJump jbox
        # Create tunnel from local port 5433 to PostgreSQL (port 5432)
        #LocalForward 5433 localhost:5432


Host *
    # Create control socket so multiple ssh/scp/sftp sessions share one connection
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/master-%r@%h:%p
    # Default to connecting via the master connection
    ControlMaster auto
    # Don't kill the master until X seconds have passed since last connection
    ControlPersist 600

    # Keep the connection alive by sending null packets every X seconds
    ServerAliveInterval 20
    # Kill connection if X number of ServerAlive messages pass with no response
    ServerAliveCountMax 3

    # Look for passphrases in the keychain - particularly useful on macOS
    UseKeychain yes
