# Jeff Widman's Brewfile
# TODO Convert to shell script since `brew bundle` is deprecated

# Make sure weâ€™re using the latest Homebrew:
update

# Upgrade any already-installed formulae:
upgrade

# Add formulae that duplicate OS X software with updated versions:
tap homebrew/dupes

# Generally life is simplest to not update OSX default SSH
# Because making a non-Apple SSH work with the OSX Keychain can be a pain
# As of OpenSSH 6.5 there's a much more secure encryption format for private keys:
# https://pthree.org/2014/12/08/super-size-the-strength-of-your-openssh-private-keys/
# Unfortunately doesn't seem to be supported by FileZilla (as of Feb 18, 2015)
# Also, no need to install HPN SSH patch per posts from 'djm' here:
# http://lwn.net/Articles/377723/
# install ssh


# Install all the things:
install zsh
install ssh-copy-id
install fasd # Fast directory switcher
install git
install gibo # quickly access Github's git ignore templates
install less
install lesspipe # pre-processes various file formats so they can be paged via Less
install ctags
install stow
install tmux
install htop
install ag # Faster grep

# Databases
install sqlite
install postgresql
install mysql
install redis

# Python
install python
install python3

# Ruby: install using [RVM](http://rvm.io/) instead of Homebrew. Much easier to manage gemsets, ruby versions, etc.


# Neovim
# I prefer over Vim for the simple reason they accepted one of my patches ;)
brew tap neovim/homebrew-neovim
brew install --HEAD neovim

# Remove outdated versions from the cellar
cleanup
